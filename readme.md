## Simple character driver module

* Work in progress, if you compile and load this module in its current state you'll get 4 toychar devices under /dev. 
* Until the driver is final (and even then :) ) I can't guarantee it won't panic your kernel so if you want to compile and load the driver I'd recommend doing so in Qemu or similar
