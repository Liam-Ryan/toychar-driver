## Simple character driver module

* Work in progress, if you compile and load this module in its current state you'll get 4 toychar devices under /dev. 
* Logic is not in place to release the devices this code is currently just a skeleton, therefore if you want to load it up I'd recommend doing so in Qemu or similar
